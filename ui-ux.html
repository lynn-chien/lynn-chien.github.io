                <p>As a part of a designathon, I created a simple interface for <a href="https://problemlibrary.org/">Problem Library</a>'s
                    new application, Educational Television. I incorporated elements of 70s and 80s television programming with a dynamic site.

                <h2>WOMP Go</h2>
                <p>I competed in a designathon for <a href="https://beta.womp.com/discover">Womp 3D</a>, a beta application where users can design 3D
                objects with ease. We were tasked to make Womp more accessible to all target users, so we converted the browser-only 
                application into a mobile one, recognizing that creating art in a tablet or mobile-form would be more familiar to users,
                especially with Womp's intention of molding 3D materials like "clay." We cut down features and honed in on the most intuitive ones, as well as adjust
                the interface to make the navigation more user-friendly.</p>

                <h2>Emosphere</h2>
                <p>As a part of a personal project, I developed "Emosphere" - an interactive site to track and understand your emotions.
                    It includes a public, anonymous message board and personal journal. There are lots of features I have yet to implement,
                    such as song recommendations and generative AI for advice-giving and communication (though the ethics of this feature would
                    need to be analyzed!), but the ultimate goal is to help users feel comfortable with their own emotions.

                <h2>Gameshelf</h2>
                <p>As a short personal project, I developed some basic UI for an idea for a mobile app called "Gameshelf." It's like Goodreads,
                    but for video games! The purpose of the app is to connect with other gamers, while also being able to browse video games across all
                    different platforms, view their ratings, and leave feedback (similar to what you would see in Steam). At the same time, you can see what
                    games your friends have played and are currently playing across Xbox, Nintendo Switch, Steam, and more!

                    Berkeley students can enter their interests, career goals, and major requirements, and we would auto-generate a variety
                    of sample four-year plans (or schedules for individual semesters).
