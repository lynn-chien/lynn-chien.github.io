                <p>Hello! My name is Lynn, and I'm originally from Las Vegas 🎰💰🌆 but am now studying data science & cognitive science at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
                <p>I love learning about human mind & behavior 🧠, as well as incorporating designs to appeal to emotions, enhance user experiences, and create meaningful connections between people and technology. 👩‍💻</p>
                <p>As a first generation student, it was difficult for me to figure out what I truly wanted to do in life, and whether I was even capable. Discovering these passions of mine excites me because they allow me to
                    combine creativity and critical thinking, empowering me to create solutions that are both meaningful and impactful! 💖💫</p>
                <p>In my free time, I enjoy drawing simple illustrations 🖌️, going on strolls on a partly cloudy day ⛅, delving in a new recipe 👩‍🍳, and watching my pet tortoise, Lampshade 🐢!
                    I also dabble in some video games... but I love learning about the rich backgrounds of characters and their world even more!</p>
